# MPMB-UA22CS-Species
This script adds all 3 of the Species from the *Unearthed Arcana 2022: The Cleric and Revised Species* article.

**Script Credit Note:**
Credit to the author of the *FToD* Dragonborn entry in "all_WotC_pub+UA.js", as I used that code as the foundation from which this UA version of the species is built on. I then spliced into this UA RaceList object aspects from the Dragonborn entry in "ListsRaces.js" & descriptions from UA22CS. Also, as can be seen below, Gem ancestry Dragonborn are included in this script. They have been included for the following reasons:
- The *FToD* code that this is based on has Gem Dragonborn & I don't want to accidentally break the code by removing this, as I only partially understand the inner workings of this code.
- Unlike in *FToD*, UA Metallic & Chromatic Dragonborn are functionally identical, so by logical extension, UA Gem Dragonborn are probably also identical to Metallic & Chromatic Dragonborn. As a result, there is no good reason to try to remove the Gem Dragonborn from this script.
Everything else in this script has been coded by myself.
